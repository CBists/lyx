/*
 * OK, here is a short description of lex/flex rules behavior.
 * The longest pattern which matches an input string is always chosen.
 * For equal-length patterns, the first occurring in the rules list is chosen.
 * INITIAL is the starting state, to which all non-conditional rules apply.
 * Exclusive states change parsing rules while the state is active.  When in
 * an exclusive state, only those rules defined for that state apply.
 *
 * We use exclusive states for quoted strings, extended comments,
 * and to eliminate parsing troubles for numeric strings.
 * Exclusive states:
 *  <xb> bit string literal
 *  <xc> extended C-style comments
 *  <xd> delimited identifiers (double-quoted identifiers)
 *  <xh> hexadecimal byte string
 *  <xq> standard quoted strings
 *  <xqs> quote stop (detect continued strings)
 *  <xe> extended quoted strings (support backslash escape sequences)
 *  <xdolq> $foo$ quoted strings
 *  <xui> quoted identifier with Unicode escapes
 *  <xus> quoted string with Unicode escapes
 *  <xeu> Unicode surrogate pair in extended quoted string
 *
 * Remember to add an <<EOF>> case whenever you add a new exclusive state!
 * The default one is probably not the right thing.

/*
 * In order to make the world safe for Windows and Mac clients as well as
 * Unix ones, we accept either \n or \r as a newline.  A DOS-style \r\n

 * newline are treated as equivalent to a single whitespace character.
 *

 * everything to the end of the input as a comment.  This is correct.  Older
 * versions of Postgres failed to recognize -- as a comment if the input

/* C-style comments
 *
 * The "extended comment" syntax closely resembles allowable operator syntax.
 * The tricky part here is to get lex to recognize a string starting with
 * slash-star as a comment, when interpreting it as an operator would produce
 * a longer match --- remember lex will prefer a longer match!  Also, if we
 * have something like plus-slash-star, lex will think this is a 3-character
 * operator whereas we want to see it as a + operator and a comment start.
 * The solution is two-fold:
 * 1. append {op_chars}* to xcstart so that it matches as much text as
 *    {operator} would. Then the tie-breaker (first matching rule of same
 *    length) ensures xcstart wins.  We put back the extra stuff with yyless()
 *    in case it contains a star-slash that should terminate the comment.
 * 2. In the operator rule, check for slash-star within the operator, and
 *    if found throw it back with yyless().  This handles the plus-slash-star
 *    problem.
 * Dash-dash comments have similar interactions with the operator rule.
